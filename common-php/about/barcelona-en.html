                        <h2>Traditional <span class="featured">Spanish Music</span> for your Big Day</h2>
                        <p>Barcelona is a city where tradition meets avant-garde, and your <strong>wedding music</strong> should reflect that same harmony. As a specialist in <strong>destination weddings in Barcelona</strong>, I provide a sophisticated <strong>instrumental</strong> soundtrack that fits perfectly within the city's most iconic settings—from the historic Gothic Quarter to the luxury terraces overlooking the Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>Whether you are hosting an <strong>intimate ceremony</strong> in a boutique hotel or a grand celebration in a modernist palace, the <strong>Spanish guitar</strong> brings an authentic sense of place. My repertoire for <strong>Barcelona weddings</strong> focuses on <strong>elegant instrumental covers of modern hits and Spanish classics</strong>, designed to provide a chic atmosphere during your <strong>cocktail hour</strong> or a soul-stirring accompaniment to your 'I do' moment.</p>
